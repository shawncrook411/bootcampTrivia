# JavaScript Trivia Game


## Description
This is a webpage to play a quick JavaScript trivia game. You will be asked a series of questions and you have to select the correct answer. If you get the answer wrong, it will deduct 15 seconds from your time remaining. If you get it right, you will be passed along to the next question. 

If you can solve all 5 questions in 30 seconds, you win! If you beat one of the highscores, it will upload your score to the leaderboard. It will also update your total win count and loss count. Your data is saved in local storage, so even if you refresh the page it will still load properly. You have the option to reset the leaderboard as well
